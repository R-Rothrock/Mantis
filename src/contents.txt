															A Primer
- `auxiliary.*`: Learning about the environment.
- `cpu.*`: Keeping track of CPU usage.
- `persistence.*`: Being persistent in said environment.
- `techniques.*`: Elevating privelidges.
- `rootkit.*`: Rooting the kernel.
- `cnc.*`: Commanding n' controlling the environment.
- `propogation.*`: Spreading to other environments.
- `signature.*`: Have a lovely chat with the REs.

														 Auxiliary
The very first goal of a malware is to be as self-aware as it can be.
It needs to be able to look around and act regarding its surroundings
accordingly. Good examples would be things like detectings an
antivirus or checking whether `ptrace` can be used.

																CPU
We don't want to use too much CPU, because that would likely start
investigation (as least it would on my computer.) We can match the
current CPU usage on the system and use that data to learn how we can
disguise our own CPU usage.

														Persistence
Utilizing Systemd, persistence can easily be established in a rather
non-suspicious way.

														 Techniques
The fun part. Instead of repeating myself, refer to `techniques.h` for
details.
															Rootkit
Once we're the root user, now the system can be rooted. Kernel modules
can be inserted, syscalls can by highjacked, and complete control can
be taken.

																CNC
Once control is taken, Mantis hands that control over to the CNC
system for complete remote access. It does this by using either DNS
or IMAP tunneling (never heard of the latter, yes? No, no you haven't)
to communicate in secret.

														Propogation
Mantis uses its extended capabilities on a system to highjack and
infect removeable storage devices. Not that this is a very effective
method of propogation, but generally automated propogation isn't in
the job description of a rootkit, so, honestly, idgaf go figure it
out.

														 Signature
Share all your innermost thoughts and feelings. Mantis will take your
message to the very ends of the world of priviledge escalation (and
maybe a little farther.)
