The embeds directory.

These files will be embeded in the Mantis as files that can be created
by the virus for whatever means. The build system will make them their
equivalent header files (i.e. example.ko.c -> example.ko ->
example.ko.h, though for things like service files we skip the first
step (of course.))

Manifest

mantis_service_user.service

When Mantis hasn't yet rooted the system, it waits patiently as a
service. This is the equivalent service file.

mantis_service_root.service

Even though we intend on being a complete rootkit, nevertheless we
will need our own service as root. This is the equivalent service
file.

mantis.ko.c

A source for a kernel module that will be used to root the system,
highjack syscalls, etc.
